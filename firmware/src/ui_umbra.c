/* UMBRA LIVE: HOME's plates in place of the ecosystem. Included by ui_lzhome.c before eco_draw.
 *
 * A plate is a picture played by the notes (voice.c trk_note_on's umb_q: keys, sequencer, arp, MIDI; a note let go:
 * velocity 0). One is the ground; up to three more lie over it as layers, their light added (umb_scene): the VEILS,
 * plates light enough to lie over another (umb_plate_t.kind UMB_KIND_OVERLAY), and BODIES, UMBRA's figures. A ground lies
 * only on MAIN, a veil only on a layer (the user, 2026-11-13). Seventeen: CORONA built in, sixteen with an install
 * (tools/build.py BANK_PLATES), eight grounds and eight veils:
 *   CINDER   cold embers: a heat field that rises and cools under a crust of cracks        (plates/cinder.c)
 *   GRANULE  the sun's surface: a honeycomb of granules, a note lights its own             (plates/granule.c)
 *   CORONA   the eclipse: the moon's disc, the corona's streamers fed by the notes         (ui_umbra_field.c: built in)
 *   TARN     the eclipse reflected in dark water, a note a drop                            (plates/tarn.c)
 *   SEPIA GYRE AURORA FATHOM RAPIDS   fluid plates: ink in water, a whirlpool, the northern lights, the sea from the
 *            side, a stream; stepped 12 .. 25 times a second and still between steps        (plates/fluid.inc)
 *   veils: BEACON ZODIAC SONAR MOTHS MARSH PACHINKO   line art from UMBRA OBSCURA, the game          (plates/ *.c)
 *          KOI MEDUSA   fish seen from above, jellyfish: made for SEPIA and FATHOM          (plates/fluid.inc)
 * (SAROS, FILAMENT, WAX, RIVULET, BLOT, BOATS, HELIX (fizz.c), BOKEH, RIDGE, QUILL and MURMUR are plate files no install brings
 * since then: the plates page can still send one.) Built to the FM-1's limits: a byte field or none, a table read and a palette
 * read a pixel, no lighting pass, fades in steps, still between notes, so the blit (gfx.c cv_blit_cells) sends little.
 * Every plate declares its elements (umb_plate.h): LIVE VIZ CTRLS (ui_umbra_mac.c) sets each one, chooses the tracks
 * whose notes drive it and links knobs, taps and the sound's own movement to it. TOTALITY (ui_umbra_tot.c), a HOME tap
 * on HOME, is the picture alone over the whole screen. */
